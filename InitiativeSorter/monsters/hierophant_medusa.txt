add LAIR 20 -100 flags:#enemy
reminder LAIR Petrifying Wave. Up to three creatures the medusa can see within the lair are partially turned to stone. Each target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.\nOn a failed save, a target's speed is reduced to 0 and can't increase. On a successful save, its speed is halved.\nThe target's speed returns to normal on initiative count 20 on the following round.\n\nSudden Stonework. The medusa creates a wall of stone on a solid surface it can see within the lair.\nThe wall can be up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. Each 5-foot section of the wall has an AC of 17; 30 hit points.\nIt has vulnerability to thunder damage; and immunity to poison, psychic, and slashing damage.\nA creature in the wall's space when the wall appears is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space on one side of the wall and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the medusa chooses the side. On a successful save, the creature chooses the side.\nThe wall disappears when the medusa uses this lair action again or when the medusa dies.\n\nUndulating Surface. Solid surfaces within the lair ripple like a snake's coils.\nUp to three creatures the medusa can see within the lair can move up to 30 feet along solid surfaces without provoking opportunity attacks.\nIf a creature moves along a surface such as a ceiling with no way to remain there (for example, sufficient handholds), it falls at the end of this movement.
