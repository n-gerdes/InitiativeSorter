In this cave area you find what appears to be an elderly hermit, pale, gaunt, and hunched over. 
He's dressed in filthy, deteriorating rags, and seems to be holding something of great interest to him.

The old man is a faerie.
He has immunity to being frightened, charmed, petrified, or paralyzed. 
If he takes damage or PCs are otherwise hostile to him then he can disappear into a puff of smoke as a reaction and does not reappear again in this adventure. 

He cherishes his shiny round rock, but is willing to part with it if his visitors can answer three riddles. 
If they answer any incorrectly then he disappears in a puff of smoke and does not reappear again in this adventure.

1)	"I know of something. The more you have of it, the less you see. What is it?" - Darkness, ignorance, or fog

2)	"I know a word. Six letters it contains. Take away one. And twelve is what remains. What is it?" - Dozens

3)	"What does man love more than life? 
	Fear more than death or mortal strife? 
	What the poor have, the rich need, and contented men desire?
	What misers spend, and spendthrifts save, and all men carry to the grave?" - Nothing

If they solve all three riddles correctly then he gifts them his shiny stone and then disappears in a puff of smoke and does not reappear in this adventure. 

His stone is a Stone of Good Luck (DMG 205; requires attunement, +1 to ability checks and saving throws).

The cave leads back out to H13 - 16
