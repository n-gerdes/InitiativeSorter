Against one of the walls you see a horizontal line of levers, all flipped down. 
Above it the number "52" is written, and below it says "We count on two fingers. The pattern holds the key". 
The switch to the far left has the number "32" written next to it, and the switch to the far right has the number "1" written next to it.
However, in front of it all, you see a shadowy creature, like a demon made of black smoky fire, clad in black iron ringmail and with a great black iron shield adorned by three glowing runes. 
Roll initiative!
