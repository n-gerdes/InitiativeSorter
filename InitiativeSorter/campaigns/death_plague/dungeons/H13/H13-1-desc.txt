The trees around are enveloped by fog. 
It creeps closer and closer, until nothing else is visible. 
Even the other party members seem to disappear into nothingness.
For several moments all is eerily still and quiet, and then it begins to recede. 
You feel a drop of rain on your shoulder as the other party members re-appear from the fog, and everyone now finds themselves standing at a cross roads. 

It's a dark, stormy night, and the moon hangs high above, somehow still visible. 
Straight ahead, just barely visible through the rain and fog the road leads to a wooded area of gnarled, crooked trees.
A lightning flash illuminates the signs behind you and to the side. 
Pointing to the right is a sign reading "POTEMKIN VILLAGE", and to the other two both read "NOWHERE".

Which way do the adventurers venture?
