Along the walls of this circular chamber is a tall stone staircase, leading up to another room above. 
A heavy-looking iron cauldron stands over the embers of a dying fire in an alcove beneath, a strange dark liquid steaming from within. 
Next to it a shelf is covered in mismatched vials and bottles with glowing liquids of varying color and consistency.
The light of floating magic candles flickers all across the dark room, casting long dancing shadows. 
An old bookshelf holds ancient tomes and grimoires, and a table covered in strange plants and vials with various powders and other scattered ingredients.
...
You hear cackling echo from upstairs (H13-6)

*Can also exit back out to H13-4
