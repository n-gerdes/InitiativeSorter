	H13-20 (the boss room). Written above it: "The pattern holds the key."
		The way is blocked by a barrier of evil magical darkness, almost like smoke. 
		It's physically permeable, but deals 3d10 necrotic damage on contact & per round to anyone 
		not invited by the witches; this is pre-emptively telegraphed by telling players that the 
		darkness seems cold and uninviting before they step in, and asking them if they're sure. 

		The darkness can be shut off by flipping the switches in H13 – 12 (page 19) to the correct pattern.
