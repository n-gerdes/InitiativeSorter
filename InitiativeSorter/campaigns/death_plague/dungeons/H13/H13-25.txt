The winding cave goes on for a long time, snaking through the ground until you come to a branch. 
It no longer goes straight ahead, but splits to the left and right.

Going south here can take the party to the haunted house's basement in H13 - 26: Haunted House Basement (page 34).
Going north-west can take the party to H13 - 11, and north-east is H13 - 14
