You enter into what appears to be an inn, an old man wiping a mug at the bar. 
It's lit dimly by a large fire in the middle of the room atop which a large iron cauldron is set. 
Several other individuals are seated at tables throughout the inn, including a shifty-looking merchant (The Name Seller), and what appears to be a band or several bands of hunters, dressed in dirty ragged clothes, with weapons by their side (The Wild Hunt).

"Ah - travelers! How can I be of service?"
